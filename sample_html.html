    <h1> BeautifulSoup </h1>
    <p> BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing HTML documents. We can use it to extract data from HTML we fetch
        from the web.
        Here, we're just using it to parse some simple sample HTML. </p>

    <h2 class="important"> Searching the tree </h2>
    <p id="searching_description" style="color: red"> BeautifulSoup allows us to search the HTML tree in lots of different ways: by tag, by
        id, by CSS class, and so on. </p>
    <ol>
        <li> By tag: we could search for every li </li>
        <li> By id: we could search for the p tag with id="searching_description" </li>
        <li class="important"> By class: we could search for every tag with a given class </li>
